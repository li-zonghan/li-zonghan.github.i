    Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

  <p>
    Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Environmental Science and Engineering at Tsinghua University.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests are environmental impact assessment, human behavior simulation, and climate change mitigation. I am mianly using tools like machine learning, statistical causal inference, large language models, structural equation models, field survey and experiment to solve the research problems.

    I am seeking a PhD opportunity beginning in Fall 2025, focusing on environmental studies including computing, social science, psychology, and (or) economics. If you are interested, please contact me!
