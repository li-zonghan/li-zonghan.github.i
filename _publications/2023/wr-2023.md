  This study introduces the Prophet-GRU hybrid model, which integrates historical water and electricity consumption data to predict hourly usage, achieving RÂ² improvements of 29.2% for water and 48.5% for electricity while reducing input parameters by 78.0%, thereby enhancing water-energy resource management.
